        <li> Learning to bake my Dad's favorite treat </li> <br>
             <ul class="info">At the age of 8, I stumbled upon a delightful avenue of expression and affection that would soon become a cherished tradition in my family â€“ baking chocolate chip cookies for my dad. Recognizing his undeniable fondness for these sweet treats, I decided to embark on a culinary journey, armed with curiosity and a childlike enthusiasm. Armed with a simple recipe and a heart full of love, I began experimenting in the kitchen, learning the art of measuring, mixing, and, of course, sneaking a few chocolate chips for myself along the way. The scent of baking cookies became synonymous with joy in our household, and with each batch, I not only honed my baking skills but also created a tangible symbol of my love and appreciation for my dad. Over the years, this delightful ritual has evolved into a heartwarming tradition, a testament to the enduring power of a child's simple gesture to bring joy to those they hold dear. </ul> <br>
        <li>Saving up to purchase my own Kitchen-aid Mixer </li> <br>
            <ul class="info">At the tender age of 13, I embarked on a journey of financial responsibility and determination that would eventually culminate in the sweet reward of owning a KitchenAid mixer. Armed with an entrepreneurial spirit, I decided to channel my energy into babysitting, transforming playdates into lucrative opportunities. As I diligently cared for little ones, I carefully stashed away every hard-earned dollar, envisioning the day when I could bring the coveted KitchenAid mixer into my kitchen. With each babysitting gig, I learned not only about the responsibilities of childcare but also the importance of patience and perseverance in working towards a goal. Finally, after months of dedication, I proudly marched into the store, armed with a wad of babysitting money, and purchased my very own KitchenAid mixer. That sweet victory served as a tangible testament to the power of ambition and the satisfaction that comes from reaping the fruits of one's labor.</ul> <br>
        <li>Working at a Bakery</li> <br>
            <ul class="info" >During my high school years, I had the incredible opportunity to work at a local bakery in my hometown, and it was a transformative experience that significantly enriched my baking skills. Under the guidance of a seasoned mentor, I immersed myself in the world of flour, sugar, and butter, absorbing the nuances of baking techniques and craftsmanship. The bakery became my classroom, and my mentor, a patient and skilled teacher, imparted invaluable knowledge about ingredient ratios, flavor combinations, and the art of precision in pastry-making. From the early morning hours kneading dough to the meticulous process of decorating cakes, every task became a lesson, and every mistake a chance to learn and improve. Through this hands-on experience, I not only honed my technical abilities but also developed a deep appreciation for the dedication and passion required to create delicious baked goods. Working at the bakery not only enhanced my baking skills but also instilled in me a profound love for the art of baking that continues to shape my culinary journey today.</ul> <br>
        <li>Watching countless Youtube videos to improve my skills</li> <br>
            <ul class="info">Immersing myself in the delectable world of baking, I found a treasure trove of knowledge and inspiration in the vast realm of YouTube videos. At the heart of my self-guided culinary education was an affinity for the enchanting universe of the Great British Bake-Off. Armed with a curious spirit and a desire to elevate my baking skills, I delved into countless tutorials and episodes, mesmerized by the artistry and precision of the contestants. From perfecting the art of icing to mastering intricate cake designs, I absorbed the wisdom and techniques shared by seasoned bakers and passionate enthusiasts alike. The screen became my canvas, and each tutorial a stepping stone toward becoming a more proficient baker. As my kitchen filled with the aroma of freshly baked delights, I marveled at the transformative power of online resources, turning my baking aspirations into tangible, delectable creations.
